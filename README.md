# NotificationBatteryChargeStatus-Windows
This program notifies the user in the Windows system about the charge status

## Backstory of the program creation

My laptop has had a problem with charging for a long time. It randomly turns off when it wants to. It has to reconnect the cable. I havenâ€™t gone to the repair service yet, so I created this program to track the charging shutdown event.
